# TODO

## Phase 0
- [x] Review analyzers and identify placeholder or heuristic logic
- [x] Review processors for performance and data flow opportunities
- [x] Review visualization for interactivity and clarity gaps
- [x] Review tests for missing coverage areas
- [x] Write Phase 0 summary doc

## Phase 1
- [ ] Redesign extended analyzer metrics with data-driven calculations (in progress)
- [ ] Improve sleep analysis metrics (latency, wake-after-onset, stage stability) (in progress)
- [ ] Improve heart rate analysis (contextual variability, recovery, zones) (in progress)
- [ ] Introduce correlation metrics with confidence scoring (in progress)
- [ ] Refactor for performance with optimized aggregation (in progress: reduced conversions in extended analyzer)
- [x] Write Phase 1 summary doc

## Phase 2
- [x] Add new interactive charts or overlays for trends and comparisons
- [x] Add anomaly and reference-range overlays
- [x] Improve chart labeling and unit handling
- [x] Write Phase 2 summary doc

## Phase 3
- [ ] Add unit tests for new analyzer logic (sleep stages, correlations, anomalies)
- [ ] Add unit tests for visualization outputs (sleep/HR charts)
- [ ] Add integration tests for report generation paths
- [ ] Verify and document coverage
- [ ] Write Phase 3 summary doc

## Phase 3
- [ ] Add unit tests for new analyzer logic
- [ ] Add integration tests for report or visualization outputs
- [ ] Verify and document coverage
- [ ] Write Phase 3 summary doc

## Phase 4
- [ ] Produce final report with improvements and remaining gaps
- [ ] Update README with new features
